# Airline-Data-Exploration-and-Modeling
The aim of this project is to build Machine Learning models to anticipate and classify the severity of an airplane accident based on past incidents. With this, all airlines, even the entire aviation industry, can predict the severity of airplane accidents caused due to various factors and, correspondingly, have a plan of action to minimize the risk associated with them.
